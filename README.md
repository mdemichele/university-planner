# university-planner
A Flask application to keep track of university credits and progress

The goal of the project was to create a dashboard in which users can keep track of the credits they have left in their program, so that they can visualize how many credits they have left to graduate. 

The app also allows for keeping track of "Finished" classes. As well as a planner feature.
